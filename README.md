A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Game Outcomes

This project trains three models using data from the 2023 LoL Esports Calendar to make predictions as to which team will win a game of LoL.
The three models implemented are: - Linear Regression - Logistic Regression - Softmax Regression

To the marking TAs, I have included a glossary that covers some of the niche terms used throughout the report.
